TO GET F-DROID GOING:

https://f-droid.org/en/docs/Setup_an_F-Droid_App_Repo/

1. Setup a new AWS EC2 instance: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EC2_GetStarted.html
	Called it within AWS F-Droid Repo

2. Within this instance I followed the instructions here:
	https://guardianproject.info/2013/11/05/setting-up-your-own-app-store-with-f-droid/

   Except before I did the final "fdroid init" I did this:
	sudo apt update && sudo apt install android-sdk
	
   I also set ANDROID_HOME to point to /usr/lib/android-sdk

3. I copied the APK over:

   scp -i ~/.ssh/FleetTLC.pem /home/dug/wrap/CarTLC/Dropbox/internal/CarTLC-r4.03.apk  ubuntu@ec2-18-188-35-199.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:
