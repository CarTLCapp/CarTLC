TO GET F-DROID GOING:

1. First setup a new AWS EC2 Instance with these instructions:

   https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/CHAP_Tutorials.WebServerDB.CreateWebServer.html

2. Now follow these instructions on setting up nginx to finally server a web page:

   https://www.nginx.com/blog/setting-up-nginx/

   With one ammendment: You will need to remove the link /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default
   I don't know why they left that out in the instructions.

3. Now you are ready for F-Droid setup. I added this to /etc/nginx/nginx.conf:

http {

	....

	  server {
                root /home/ubuntu/public_html;

                location /fdroid {
                }

                location /fdroid/repo {
                }

        }
}



4. Now create this directory:

	/home/ubuntu/public_html/fdroid

5. As a sanity check add a simple index.html to the fdroid directory and try to reach it from the browser.

6. Get the ANDROID sdk installed on the machine:

       sudo apt update && sudo apt install android-sdk
       Set ANDROID_HOME to point to /usr/lib/android-sdk

7. Follow the instructions here on how to set it up: https://f-droid.org/en/docs/Setup_an_F-Droid_App_Repo/

       To copy APK over:

       scp -i ~/.ssh/FleetTLC.pem /home/dug/wrap/CarTLC/Dropbox/internal/CarTLC-r4.03.apk  ubuntu@ec2-18-188-35-199.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:

8. Now within the F-Droid APP add a new repository and specify the http address to it ending in .../fdroid/repo

       When I did this I finally saw F-DROID working.
